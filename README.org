* Embedded Tests

** What?
This repo was for me to explore the ideas of embedded *Julia* and *Common*
*Lisp*. Well A little bit more complex than that. You see I wanted these
languages to also to make use of *C++* libraries that I write. Well
with one exception. There are two *Common Lisp* directories: *ecl*
and *sbcl*. The later *sbcl* is not actually embeddable, but would be
preferred to *ecl*. That was me exploring the idea of writing the
executable itself in *sbcl* so that I could use it as the scripting
language. SBCL was decided upon in the end due to the speed of it and
due to the issues I ran into with *ecl*.

** Why?
These examples were useful so that I could explore using a scripting
language that I am comfortable with in a cross-platform compatible
environment. My end goal is to use these examples to use these for a
game engine. However, this concept could easily be extended to many
different use cases.
