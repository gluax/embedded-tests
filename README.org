* Embedded Tests

** What?
This repo was for me to explore the ideas of embedded *Julia* and *Common*
*Lisp*. Well A little bit more complex than that
languages to also to make use of *C++* libraries that I write
with one exception
and *sbcl*
preferred to *ecl*
executable itself in *sbcl* so that I could use it as the scripting
language
due to the issues I ran into with *ecl*

** Why?
These examples were useful so that I could explore using a scripting
language that I am comfortable with in a cross-platform compatible
environment
game engine
different use cases

- [[file:julia/README
- [[file:sbcl/README
